\section{Introduction}

As discussed in Chapter \ref{chapter:Introduction}, dust is composed of metals that are produced from stellar nucleosynthesis, and then expelled into the ISM via supernovae and stellar winds. While some fraction of these metals mix with the gas phase in the ISM, around $30 - 50\%$ of the metals condense into dust grains (\citealt{Draine_2007b}). If this fraction of metals that get locked up in dust grains is somewhat consistent over time, then dust may be considered a useful tracer of gas metallicity in a galaxy. For this reason, the total dust mass is a fundamental property of the ISM that can be used to study the evolutionary stage of the galaxy (e.g. \citealt{Cortese_2012}; \citealt{deVis_2017a}; \citealt{deVis_2017b}). Moreover, dust is not just the product of previous star formation, but also, as the site of molecule formation like $H_2$, it has a significant influence on the formation of molecular clouds for future star formation. Understanding the dust content of galaxies over cosmic time is therefore important in providing insight into the evolution of galaxies and their ISM. In this Chapter, we estimate the dust masses of the galaxies in the South Galactic Pole field and derive the far-IR selected dust mass function in redshift slices of width $0.2$ out to $z = 1$.

\section{Local and High Redshift DMFs in the Literature}

Using surveys selected from sub-mm wavelengths provides a number of advantages when determining the DMF. At longer sub-mm wavelengths we sample the Rayleigh-Jeans tail of the Planck function where the flux density is least sensitive to the temperature of the dust and most sensitive to the dust's mass. Prior to the surveys conducted with \textit{Herschel}, \textit{Planck} and SCUBA in the local Universe, estimates of the local DMF often started from local \textit{IRAS} 60\,\micron\ luminosity functions (LF) and extrapolating this to sub-mm wavelengths on the assumption of an average far-IR SED with a single dust temperature and dust emissivity index $\beta$ for all galaxies. Naturally, this lead to strong dependency on the assumed dust temperature and $\beta$ value. Given that temperature evolves with luminosity (see our study on the temperature evolution with redshift for dusty star forming galaxies, DSFGs; Figure \ref{fig:t_evolution}), extrapolating from one wavelength to another inherently contained a bias at high and low luminosity scales, causing a distortion in any DMF measured from the translation of the luminosity function (\citealt{Dunne_2000}). The advent of \textit{Herschel} and \textit{Planck} allowed for large samples to be detected at far-IR wavelengths closer to the peak of the dust emission, enabling estimates of the DMF directly from sub-mm wavebands. The main disadvantage of these long wavelength derived DMFs is the large beam size at these wavebands, causing blending and source misidentification (as illustrated in our use of the Likelihood Ratio method in the previous chapter).

The first direct measurements of the sub-mm derived DMF were with SCUBA using the SCUBA Local Universe Galaxy Survey (SLUGS: \citealt{Dunne_2000}; \citealt{Dunne_2001}; \citealt{Vlahakis_2005}), a survey of local \textit{IRAS}-selected galaxies. However, these studies were limited by small number statistics and were limited to very small redshifts. A high redshift ($z = 2.5$) DMF for comparison was presented in \citealt{Dunne_2003}, suggesting that galaxies with the highest dust masses have an order of magnitude more dust than locally (assuming pure dust mass evolution and no evolution in the number density of the most massive galaxies). An obvious drawback of these studies is that even though extapolations of the \textit{IRAS} 60\,\micron\ LF were no longer required, the SLUGS studies depended on sub-mm observations of samples of galaxies selected in other wavebands. Improvements were made with the introduction of the Balloon-borne Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (BLAST; \citealt{Devlin_2009}) {\color{red}Repeated acronym and citation}, which allowed for the detection and derivation of the DMF from a sample of galaxies selected at wavelengths spanning the peak of the far-IR spectrum (the wavelengths of BLAST were 250, 350 and 500\,\micron\, as it was designed as a precursor to the \textit{Herschel}-SPIRE instrument). \citealt{Eales_2009} used BLAST data to arrive at similar conclusions, that there is strong evolution in the LF and in the DMF out to z = 1. The concurrence of the two suggesting that the evolution in the sub-mm luminosity of these galaxies is directly related to the increase in the size of their dust reservoirs. However, this study was also limited by small number statistics ($\sim$ 100 sources).

The first study to measure the evolution in the DMF using the large area of H-ATLAS was \citealt{Dunne_2011}, using a 250\,\micron\ selected sample of 1867 sources from the SDP. This represented a sample an order of magnitude larger than previous studies, allowing for a significant direct measurement of the density of galaxies as a function of dust mass to a redshift of 0.5. The main conclusions about the DMF between $0 < z < 0.5$ from this study were that dust masses of the most massive galaxies decreased by a factor of 4 or 5 over the past 5 billion years and the integrated dust density of the universe evolves with redshift according to $\rho_{\textrm{dust}} \propto (1+z)^{4.5}$. The local density was estimated to be $\rho_{\textrm{dust}, (z=0)} = 9.8\times10^4$\,$M_\odot$ Mpc$^{-3}$. This work was developed further in \citealt{Beeston_2018} by deriving the local ($z < 0.1$) DMF for the largest sample of galaxies at the time of writing ($\sim$ 16,000 galaxies), utilizing the crossmatching between the H-ATLAS and the GAMA spectroscopic survey detailed in \citealt{Bourne_2016}. The sample size of \citealt{Beeston_2018} permitted signifcant numbers of galaxies with dust masses as low as $\sim$ $10^4$\,$M_\odot$ and therefore extended the observed range of the DMF by at least an order of magnitude compared to previous measurements. This yielded better constraints on the low mass end of the DMF which, despite accounting for a negligible amount of the dust budget compared to the most massive galaxies, contribute substantially in number. There are a wide range of predictions for the number density of low dust mass galaxies as this regime is constrained by sources that tend to be nearby and faint, and suffer from low numbers in flux-limited surveys such as H-ATLAS. With the size of the \citealt{Beeston_2018} sample the measurement of the low mass end of the DMF in this study are currently our best estimate. Despite differences in the measured number density of low mass galaxies, \citealt{Dunne_2011} and \citealt{Beeston_2018} both have local dust mass densities (DMD) in good agreement.

More recently, \citealt{Driver_2018} produced an extended DMF and measured the DMD out to $z = 5$. This study was based on an optically-selected sample of approximately 570,000 galaxies from GAMA, G10-COSMOS (\citealt{Davies_2015}; \citealt{Andrews_2017}) and 3D-HST (\citealt{Brammer_2012}; \citealt{Momcheva_2016}). Unlike \citealt{Dunne_2011}, this study found no evidence for a strong evolution in the dust content of galaxies in the past 5\,Gyr, instead observing a flat DMD since $z = 0.5$. However, an apparent evolution in the dust luminosity observed by \citealt{Driver_2018} suggests that a strong evolution in dust temperature is required in order to maintain a flat DMD. Other notable works that measure the evolution of the DMF to high redshifts include \citealt{Pozzi_2020} and \citealt{Dudzeviciute_2021}. The former derived the DMF from $z \sim 0.2$ to $z \sim 2.5$ using a 160\,\micron\ \textit{Herschel}-PACS selected catalogue of approximately 5,300 galaxies in the COSMOS field. In a juxtaposition to \citealt{Dunne_2011} and \citealt{Driver_2018}, they find a peak in the redshift evolution of the DMD in accordance with \citealt{Driver_2018}, but a positive trend at $z < 0.5$, in agreement with the work of \citealt{Dunne_2011}. The implication of this result being that consistency among these studies depends strongly on the selection of the sample, survey area or any assumptions that may be made during the measurement of the dust masses of the galaxies. We note that of the studies used for comparison in this work, the sample of \citealt{Pozzi_2020} is selected from the shortest observed frame wavelength (160\,\micron), which may in part explain the differences observed in the DMFs due to the strong dependence on dust temperature (we explore this further in Section \ref{sec:schechter_functions}). Finally, \citealt{Dudzeviciute_2021} add valuable constraints on the DMF at $z = 1 - 2$ and $z = 3 - 4$ based on two samples selected at wavelengths corresponding to nearly indentical rest frame $\sim$ 180\,\micron\ populations. At $z < 2$, \citealt{Dudzeviciute_2021} studied the dust properties of 121 SMGs from the 450\,\micron\ SCUBA-2 Ultra Deep Imaging EAO Survey (STUDIES: \citealt{Wang_2017}; \citealt{Chang_2018}; \citealt{Lim_2020b}; \citealt{Lim_2020c}) and compared these results to an 850\,\micron\ SMG sample from the ALMA/SCUBA-2 Ultra Deep Survey (AS2UDS: \citealt{Stach_2018}; \citealt{Stach_2019}, \citealt{Dudzeviciute_2020}). 

In this study, we derive the DMF from the galaxies observed in the H-ATLAS SGP field. The sub-mm data used to derive the dust masses come from the second data release of the \textit{Herschel}-ATLAS. We include in our study those galaxies matched with high likelihood to a VIKING counterpart with an estimated redshift. The dust masses are calculated from the \textit{Herschel}-SPIRE 250\,\micron\ fluxes, and thus our estimates of the DMF are likely to follow similar observed trends as in the previous H-ATLAS studies of \citealt{Dunne_2011} and \citealt{Beeston_2018}. The work presented here allows us to expand on these works by extending the \textit{Herschel} predicted DMF to higher redshifts as a result of the increased depth from the near-IR crossmatching. In addition, we implement an error analysis that propagates errors in the photometric redshifts through to the final DMF, allowing us to use a sample devoid of spectroscopic redshifts. The spectroscopic coverage of the SGP is much lower than the GAMA fields, but in this way we are able to use the complete SGP catalogue with the following criteria: i) sources must be classified as galaxies accordingly with the method in Section \ref{sec:star_galaxy_classifier}; ii) SGP galaxies have a near-IR counterpart with a reliability > 0.8; and iii) the near-IR counterpart has a photometric redshift in HELP. This corresponds to a sample of 81,895 galaxies, making it the most statistically significant measurement of the DMF made with the \textit{Herschel}-ATLAS.

\section{Dust Properties of H-ATLAS Galaxies}

In order to measure the rest frame dust properties of the H-ATLAS galaxies over a wide range of redshifts, we require an understanding of the typical dust SED and any changes it may exhibit over time. To estimate our rest frame dust masses, we must k-correct our results to the same wavelength, causing our results to be dependent on the assumed dust temperature and dust emissivity index that describes the SED of each galaxy. Although galaxies contain dust with a range of dust temperatures, previous studies have shown that most of the interstellar dust has a temperature of $\sim$ 20\,K (e.g. \citealt{Dunne_2001}; \citealt{Vlahakis_2005}; \citealt{Draine_2007a}; \citealt{Boselli_2010}; \citealt{Smith_2012b}; \citealt{Smith_2013}). However, dust close to sources of heating such as star forming regions and AGN radiate at rest frame wavelengths $\lesssim$ 100\,\micron\ and can influence the temperature measured from an isothermal dust model. Due to this mixing of temperatures, the ideal scenario would be to estimate the dust mass of a galaxy using a mass-weighted temperature of the dust. This would require fitting a model with multiple temperature components and weighting the temperatures of the dust by their mass. However, it has already been shown that the cold dust reservoir at $\sim$ 20\,K has the most signifcant contribution by mass (\citealt{Pearson_2013}) and the difference between the mass weighted dust temperature and the isothermal temperature is often not significant (e.g. \citealt{Clark_2015}). For example, if we assume that H-ATLAS galaxies are well approximated by the two temperature model of \citealt{Pearson_2013} (Section \ref{sec:phot_z_Herschel}; where $T_{\textrm{hot}}$ = 46.9\,K, $T_{\textrm{cold}}$ = 23.9\,K and $\alpha = M_c/M_h$ = 30.1), then the mass weighted temperature is given by $T_{\textrm{dust, weighted}} = (M_cT_c + M_hT_h)/(M_c + M_h) \approx$ 24.6\,K, which is only marginally warmer than the cold dust component. In addition, to constrain a hotter dust component at $\lambda_{\textrm{rest}} \lesssim$ 100\,\micron\ we would require data from shorter wavelength photometry such as \textit{Herschel}-PACS with significant constraining power. As shown in Table \ref{tab:snr_fraction}, the percentage of galaxies in our reliable sample ($R > 0.8$) that have significant detections at the PACS wavelengths decreases rapidly with redshift to as low as $\sim$ 6 -- 8\% by $z \sim 0.3$. With so few galaxies in our redshift range having PACS detections with useful SNR, the ability to adequately fit an SED to the \textit{Herschel} wavelengths is almost the same when considering a single or multiple temperature model. The benefit, however, of an isothermal model is the reduction in model parameters that may otherwise be left unconstrained if multiple temperatures are assumed.

    \label{tab:snr_fraction}
\end{table}

Without sufficient data to constrain the dust temperature and $\beta$ simultaneously, we assume a fixed $\beta = 2$ and fit an isothermal modified blackbody to all galaxies. In Figure \ref{fig:dust_temperatures} we plot the distribution of measured dust temperatures as a function of photometric redshift. We see that the median value at all redshifts is consistent with 20\,K, which we shall assume herein as the typical temperature of the cold ISM. The righthand panel of Figure \ref{fig:dust_temperatures} shows the distribution of dust temperatures (black histogram) and the contributions from galaxies with one (red), two (blue) and three (green) SPIRE observations with flux densities at greater than 4$\sigma$ significance. As previously shown by \citealt{Beeston_2018} the galaxies with significant \textit{Herschel} fluxes in all three SPIRE wavebands are on average colder than those with only one or two bands. The majority of galaxies occupying higher dust temperatures are those with only a single photometric constraint greater than 4$\sigma$, suggesting that this tail in the temperature distribution may in part be an artefact of the blackbody fitting.

The righthand panel shows the histogram of dust temperatures for all galaxies (grey filled), galaxies with SNR > 4 in one band (red), in two bands (blue) and in three bands (green).}
	\label{fig:dust_temperatures}
\end{figure}

In the next section we shall start from the assumption that the dust spectrum of all galaxies in our sample can be approximated by an SED with a characteristic dust temperature equal to the median temperature of 20\,K when deriving the DMF (e.g. \citealt{Vlahakis_2005}). This is required for certain methods used to derive a binned DMF in $M_{\textrm{dust}}-z$ space as they rely on knowledge of the shape of the SED to apply appropriate k-corrections in each bin. This allows us to use all the galaxies in our sample, regardless of the SNR in the \textit{Herschel} wavebands. As we shall explain later, some methods for calculating binned functions allow for each galaxy to use its own SED rather than a global SED to compute the required k-corrections. We shall discuss how this impacts our DMF by allowing this freedom for the galaxies in the SGP where the dust spectrum is well fit by a modified blackbody.

A dust mass can be calculated from the monochromatic rest frame luminosity, which in turn can be obtained from the observed flux density at a given wavelength. We translate the 250\,\micron\ flux densities of the SGP galaxies into monochromatic luminosities using

\begin{equation}
    L_{250} = \frac{4\pi D_L^2 S_{250}K}{(1+z)},
\label{eq:monohromatic_luminosities}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $L_{250}$ is in units of W Hz$^{-1}$, $D_L$ is the luminosity distance, $S_{250}$ is the observed flux density at 250\,\micron\ and $K$ is the k-correction that allows us to define a rest frame quantity at 250\,\micron\ in terms of the observed frame at the same wavelength, given by

\begin{equation}
    K = \frac{S_{250}^{K}}{S_{250}^{\textrm{obs}}} = \Bigg(\frac{\nu_{K}}{\nu_{\textrm{obs}}}\Bigg)^{3+\beta}\frac{e^{(h\nu_{\textrm{obs}}/kT)} - 1}{e^{(h\nu_{K}/kT)} - 1},
\label{eq:k_correction}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\nu_{K} = \nu_{\textrm{obs}}(1+z)$ and $T$ and $\beta$ are the dust temperature and emissivity index describing the SED. Let us consider a galaxy at the edge of our redshift range, $z \sim 1$. The factor $K$ allows us to convert $S_{250}^{\textrm{obs}}$, the emission radiated at 250\,\micron\ (1.2\,THz) and observed at 125\,\micron\ (2.4\,THz) to $S_{250}^{K}$, the 250\,\micron\ flux density in the galaxy's rest frame. The monochromatic luminosity at 250\,\micron\ is then converted to a dust mass using

\begin{equation}
    M_{\textrm{dust}} = \frac{L_{250}}{4\pi\kappa_{250}B(\nu_{250}, T)},
\label{fig:dust_mass}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\kappa_{250}$ is the dust mass absorption coefficient at 250\,\micron\. The dust mass absoprtion coefficient is an amalgamation of terms including the efficiency with which the dust grains emit in reference to a perfect blackbody, the size of the dust grains and their mass volume density. As will be discussed in Chapter \ref{chapter:Dust_Evolution}, the frequency dependence of the absorption coefficient, $\kappa_\nu$, can be parameterized as a power law with an exponent of $\beta$ and thus the value of $\beta$ naturally encodes these properties. For this reason, the value of $\kappa_\nu$ is highly uncertain with a wide range of values spanning multiple orders of magnitude being presented in the literature (\citealt{Clark_2019}). A commonly used value is 0.077\,m$^{2}$kg$^{-1}$ at 850\,\micron\ (\citealt{Dunne_2000}; \citealt{daCunha_2008}; \citealt{Dunne_2011}) which represents a theoretical value that lies between the expected value for graphite and silicate dust grains (\citealt{Draine_1984}). Assuming $\beta = 2$ we scale this value to 250\,\micron\ such that $\kappa_{250}$ = 0.89\,m$^{2}$kg$^{-1}$.

\section{Sources of Incompleteness}

When deriving our DMF we must consider the completeness of our far-IR selected survey and account for missing galaxies in our volume density calculations. The DMFs determined from galaxies selected in H-ATLAS and matched to an optical/near-IR catalogue will naturally have an incompleteness from the flux-limited sub-mm and optical/near-IR catalogues and from our selection of high reliability matches. In the following sections we outline the methods we used to estimate the incompleteness of our sample and thus the completeness correction factors we apply to our SGP catalogue. Each object in our reliable sample is multiplied by a correction factor that compensates for missing sub-mm sources and detected sources without counterparts identified by our Bayesian LR method. 

\subsection{Sub-mm Catalogue Incompleteness}

The first correction factor results from the source extraction process used to create the catalogues from the \textit{Herschel} maps. Due to source confusion these catalogues are incomplete as we approach the flux-limit of the survey. To determine the completeness of the H-ATLAS source catalogues, \citealt{Valiante_2016} used a catalogue of simulated sources embedded in real H-ATLAS maps to predict the efficiency of the \texttt{MADX} algorithm in recovering the sources. The completeness is shown as a function of the measured 250\,\micron\ flux density in Figure \ref{fig:submm_completeness} and is listed in Table \ref{tab:submm_completeness_table} along with the correction factors, $c_{\textrm{sub-mm}}$, defined as the reciprocal of the completeness. We use an interpolated version of this table when applying the correction factors to our SGP galaxies. Unsurprisingly, the highest correction factors are found below the typical flux limit of the survey ($\sim$ 30\,mJy) where confusion noise dominates and the likelihood of lost sources rises.

    \end{tabular}
    \caption{The near-IR ID completeness and corresponding correction factors as a function of redshift.}
    \label{tab:id_completeness_table}
\end{table}

\subsection{Near-IR Catalogue Incompleteness}

A second correction typically applied to far-IR derived DMFs results from the incompleteness in the optical/near-IR matching catalogue as we approach the limiting magnitude of this survey. In the GAMA study of \citealt{Dunne_2011} it is shown that the SDSS catalogue is incomplete as we approach the $r$-band flux limit by extrapolating the slope of the number counts in complete bins to fainter magnitudes. The completeness at the faintest magnitudes is then estimated from the difference between the extrapolated number counts and the observed counts. This method assumed that the SDSS catalogue is close to 100\% complete between $r$-band magnitudes of 19 -- 21.5. 

This correction is of particular importance for optically selected samples where the fraction of sub-mm sources that do not have associations on the optical images, $1 - Q$, is a significant fraction of the total sample. As shown in Table \ref{tab:data_release_input_surveys}, this fraction is approximately 40 -- 50\% for SDSS, while for the VIKING analysis of the SGP it is only $\sim$ 20\%. In addition, the missing 20\% of near-IR counterparts are likely to be at high redshift with many expected to be beyond the upper limit used in this study ($z = 1$). {\color{red} Evidence?}

\subsection{Reliable ID Incompleteness}

The final correction function arises from our inability to identify all the near-IR counterparts with a sufficiently high reliability for the sub-mm sources in which there is at least one counterpart on the near-IR image. As detailed in the previous chapter, our confidence in selecting the appropriate ID for each source is lowered by large positional uncertainties, the possibility of coincident background objects and multiple systems that are physically associated with each other but are treated independently with the LR method.

A completeness function for our reliable IDs allow us to correct for the number density of sources that have near-IR counterparts below the limiting magnitude of the VIKING survey, but were not retained in the final sample. In order to estimate the completeness of our reliable sample we use a similar method to the one used to calculate the probability distribution of true counterparts, $q(m)$, in Section \ref{sec:true_counterparts_distribution}. We calculate the completeness function as a function of redshift given that we require this for all galaxies in our DMF calculation. As a means of comparison, we can start with a first order approximation using the fraction of all sub-mm sources where we observe near-IR counterparts and the percentage of these sources that are deemed reliable. We observe VIKING objects for 83\% of sub-mm sources while 57\% are considered in our final sample with $R > 0.8$. From this we know that approximately 69\% of all \textit{Herschel} galaxies in the SGP are contained within our reliable sample, suggesting that our average ID correction factor, $c_{\textrm{id}} \approx 1/0.69 \approx 1.46$.

In its simplest form, the completeness of our reliable sample is defined as the redshift distribution of our IDs divided by the true redshift distribution of SPIRE counterparts, scaled to the number of sources for which we observe nearby VIKING counterparts; $C_{\textrm{id}} = n_{\textrm{reliable}}(z)/n_{\textrm{real, scaled}}(z)$. This second term is closely related to the probability distribution of true counterparts as a function of redshift, $q(z)$. Using the same formalism as Equation \ref{eq:true_counterparts_distribution}, we define the denominator as

\begin{equation}
    n_{\textrm{real, scaled}} = q(z)\times N_{\textrm{250\,\micron}} = \frac{n_{\textrm{real}}(z)}{\sum_{z_i}n_{\textrm{real}}(z_i)}\times QN_{\textrm{250\,\micron}},
    \label{eq:n_real_scaled}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $n_{\textrm{real}}(z)$ is the redshift distribution of true counterparts (see Equation \ref{eq:real_distribution}) and $N_{\textrm{250\,\micron}}$ is the number of SPIRE positions. As previously, the required correction functions are the reciprocal of the completeness. When we derived the $q(m)$ distribution in Section \ref{sec:true_counterparts_distribution} we noted that the distribution is normalized such that the integal of $q(m)$ over all magnitudes up to the limiting magnitude of the VIKING survey is equal to the probability that the source is detected ($\int^{m_\textrm{lim}} q(m) dm = Q$). As an extension of this normalization, we recognize that the integral of the ID redshift distribution multiplied by the correction factors should give the total number of sources with observable counterparts (i.e. $\int_z c_{\textrm{id}} n_{\textrm{reliable}}(z) dz = QN_{\textrm{250\,\micron}}$, where $c_{\textrm{id}}$ are the correction factors given by $1/C_{\textrm{id}}$).

The ID completeness as a function of redshift is listed in Table \ref{tab:id_completeness_table} and illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:id_completeness} alongside the completeness functions from the SDP (\citealt{Smith_2011}), GAMA9 field (\citealt{Fleuren_2012}) and NGP (\citealt{Bourne_2016}). The average correction factor per source in the SGP is approximately two, which is significantly larger than our first order approximation. Near the median redshift of the distribution ($z \sim 0.5$) the completeness is lower in the SGP than in other fields, though we note that we do not include spectroscopic redshifts and the fraction of IDs with redshifts is different among the optical/near-IR surveys. The general trend for all H-ATLAS fields is a steady decline from 100\% completeness at $z = 0$ to a minimum at $z \sim$ 0.5 -- 0.7 followed by a rise at higher redshifts. \citealt{Bourne_2016} postulate why the completenss is highest at low and high redshift. First, at low redshifts, a fixed search radius will correspond to a smaller physical scale and thus likely to contain fewer counterparts. This would explain the steady decline to $z \sim 0.5$. At higher redshifts the ID completeness rises again suggesting that the probability of identifying a VIKING ID increases with redshift, though this could also relate to the larger photometric redshift errors. A possible argument is that at higher redshifts where we approach the magnitude limit of the VIKING survey, we are less prone to correlated neighbours which would otherwise reduce the reliability of our ID.

\section{Estimators of the Binned Dust Mass Function}
\label{sec:dmf_estimators}

The dust mass function, $\phi(M_{\textrm{dust}})$, represents the space density of galaxies as a function of dust mass, which in its differential form is given as the number of galaxies per unit comoving volume per unit dust mass interval:

\begin{equation}
    \phi(M_{\textrm{dust}}, z) = \frac{d^2N}{dV dM_{\textrm{dust}}},
\label{eq:differential_phi}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $N$ is the number of galaxies with dust mass $M_{\textrm{dust}}$ observed in the comoving volume $V$ at redshift $z$. In this section we outline two methods of calculating the binned dust mass function; the ubiquitously used $1/V_{\textrm{max}}$ method (\citealt{Schmidt_1968}; \citealt{Felten_1976}; \citealt{Avni_1980}) and the approximate method, $\phi_{\textrm{est}}$, proposed by \citealt{Page_2000}. Alternative parametric methods (e.g. the maximum-likelihood method of \citealt{Marshall_1983}) allow us to explore the entire $M_{\textrm{dust}} - z$ space, including regions that are not covered by observational data, and allow us to produce continuous functions for $\phi(M_{\textrm{dust}}, z)$. Although it is well established that the dust mass function can be parameterized in the form of a Schechter function (\citealt{Press_1974}; \citealt{Schechter_1976}), it is not obvious how this function evolves with redshift and which functional form should be used for this evolution. For this reason, we prefer to use binned, non-parametric methods and empirically study the redshift evolution of the DMF.

\subsection{The $1/V_{\textrm{max}}$ Method}

The prevalent use of the $1/V_{\textrm{max}}$ method stems from our need to overcome the Malmquist bias (\citealt{Eddington_1914}; \citealt{Malmquist_1922}) that causes selection biases in flux density limited samples. At a given redshift the faintest galaxies are statistically more likely to be left out of the survey, while the most luminous galaxies can be observed at a greater distance. As a result, there is an observational mass bias in which faint and thus low-mass galaxies are only detected in smaller volumes compared to brighter galaxies. The $1/V_{\textrm{max}}$ method corrects for this bias by weighting each galaxy according to the maximum comoving volume in which it can be observed by the survey. The number density of galaxies in a given dust mass-redshift bin ($\Delta M_{\textrm{dust}} \Delta z$) is approximately given by the sum of the reciprocal of the maximum comoving volume for all galaxies in this bin:

\begin{equation}
    \frac{dN}{dV} \sim \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{1}{V_{\textrm{max,i}}(M_{\textrm{dust,i}},z)},
\label{eq:number_density_1/v_method}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $V_{\textrm{max,i}}$ is the maximum comoving volume in which the $i$th galaxy in this bin could be detected by the survey. The volume is calculated according to

\begin{align}
    V_{\textrm{max},i}(M_{\textrm{dust,i}},z) &= \int^{\scriptscriptstyle \textrm{survey}} \int_{\scriptscriptstyle z_1}^{\scriptscriptstyle \textrm{min}[z_2, z(M_{\textrm{dust,i}},S_{\textrm{lim}})]} \frac{dV}{dz} dz d\Omega \nonumber \\
    &= \int^{\scriptscriptstyle \textrm{survey}} \int_{\scriptscriptstyle z_1}^{\scriptscriptstyle \textrm{min}[z_2, z(M_{\textrm{dust,i}},S_{\textrm{lim}})]} D_H \frac{(1+z)^2 D_A^2}{E(z)} dz d\Omega
\label{eq:volume_1/v_method}
\end{align}

\noindent where $\frac{dV}{dz}$ is the differential comoving volume given in the following line in terms of the Hubble distance, $D_H$, the angular diameter distance, $D_A$, and the dimensionless Hubble parameter, $E(z)$. The integration over redshift has limits from the bottom redshift of the bin, $z_1$, to either the upper edge of the bin, $z_2$, or the redshift beyond which the galaxy with dust mass $M_{\textrm{dust},i}$ would not be observed, whichever is smallest. A graphical illustration of the dust mass-volume space available to a galaxy with a dust mass $M_{\textrm{dust},i}$ is presented in the left-hand panel of Figure \ref{fig:volume_comparison}.

The dust mass function using this method is then defined by dividing the number density by the dust mass bin width (which we define in terms of logarithmic dust mass):

\begin{equation}
    \phi_{1/V}(M_{\textrm{dust}},z) = \frac{1}{\Delta \textrm{log}_{10}(M_{\textrm{dust}})} \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{1}{V_{\textrm{max,i}}(M_{\textrm{dust,i}},z)}.
\label{eq:phi_1/v_method}
\end{equation}

To account for the incompleteness of the sample we include the correction factors we derived in the previous section in the following way:

\begin{equation}
    \phi_{1/V}(M_{\textrm{dust}},z) = \frac{1}{\Delta \textrm{log}_{10}(M_{\textrm{dust}})} \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{c_{\scriptscriptstyle \textrm{sub-mm}} c_{\scriptscriptstyle \textrm{id}}}{V_{\textrm{max,i}}(M_{\textrm{dust,i}},z)}.
\label{eq:phi_1/v_method}
\end{equation}

While this method suitably deals with Malmquist bias and does not require an a-priori analytic form, it can produce some unwanted artefacts when applied to flux-limited samples. An alternative method that better handles the accessible volume calculation for objects close to the flux limit of the survey is the method of \citealt{Page_2000} (hereafter PC00).

\subsection{The Page and Carrera Method}

In the $1/V_{\textrm{max}}$ method we assume that the accessible comoving volume in which a galaxy could have been detected by the survey is constant across all dust masses in a given $M_{\textrm{dust}} - z$ bin. The PC00 method has the advantage that the comoving volume is defined from the average value for all dust masses in the interval $\Delta M_{\textrm{dust}}$. In a similar fashion as before, the number density of galaxies is approximately given by the sum of all galaxies in the bin divided by the average accessible volume, 

\begin{equation}
    \frac{dN}{dV} \sim \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N 1}{V_{\textrm{max,av}}(M_{\textrm{dust}},z)},
\label{eq:number_density_pc00_method}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $V_{\textrm{max,av}}$ now represents an average volume for all galaxies in the bin. This volume is averaged over all dust masses in the range $M_{\textrm{dust, 1}} < M_{\textrm{dust}} < M_{\textrm{dust, 2}}$ following

\begin{multline}
    V_{\textrm{max,av}}(M_{\textrm{dust}},z) = \frac{1}{\Delta \textrm{log}_{10}(M_\textrm{dust})}\int_{\scriptscriptstyle M_{\textrm{dust,1}}}^{\scriptscriptstyle M_{\textrm{dust,2}}} \int^{\scriptscriptstyle \textrm{survey}} \int_{\scriptscriptstyle z_1}^{\scriptscriptstyle \textrm{min}[z_2, z(M_{\textrm{dust}},S_{\textrm{lim}})]} \\ D_H \frac{(1+z)^2 D_A^2}{E(z)} dz d\Omega d\textrm{log}_{10}(M_\textrm{dust}),
\label{eq:volume_pc00_method}
\end{multline}

\noindent which is akin to Equation \ref{eq:volume_1/v_method}, except we integrate over all dust masses and divide by the bin width. Crucially, this means that we are not dependent on any individual estimate of the dust mass, $M_{\textrm{dust,i}}$. The dust mass-volume space for an example bin is shown in the right-hand panel of Figure \ref{fig:volume_comparison}. In the same manner as before, the dust mass function is defined as the number density divided by the dust mass bin width:

\begin{align}
    \phi_{\textrm{est}}(M_{\textrm{dust}},z) &= \frac{1}{\Delta \textrm{log}_{10}(M_{\textrm{dust}})} \times \nonumber \\
    & \qquad \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N c_{\scriptscriptstyle \textrm{sub-mm}} c_{\scriptscriptstyle \textrm{id}}}{\frac{1}{\Delta \textrm{log}_{10}(M_\textrm{dust})}\int_{\scriptscriptstyle M_{\textrm{dust,1}}}^{\scriptscriptstyle M_{\textrm{dust,2}}} \int^{\scriptscriptstyle \textrm{survey}} \int_{\scriptscriptstyle z_1}^{\scriptscriptstyle \textrm{min}[z_2, z(M_{\textrm{dust}},S_{\textrm{lim}})]} D_H \frac{(1+z)^2 D_A^2}{E(z)} dz d\Omega d\textrm{log}_{10}(M_\textrm{dust})} \nonumber \\
    &= \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N c_{\scriptscriptstyle \textrm{sub-mm}} c_{\scriptscriptstyle \textrm{id}}}{\int_{\scriptscriptstyle M_{\textrm{dust,1}}}^{\scriptscriptstyle M_{\textrm{dust,2}}} \int^{\scriptscriptstyle \textrm{survey}} \int_{\scriptscriptstyle z_1}^{\scriptscriptstyle \textrm{min}[z_2, z(M_{\textrm{dust}},S_{\textrm{lim}})]} D_H \frac{(1+z)^2 D_A^2}{E(z)} dz d\Omega d\textrm{log}_{10}(M_\textrm{dust})}.
\label{eq:phi_pc00_method}
\end{align}

In the PC00 method, the accessible volume is calculated for each $M_{\textrm{dust}} - z$ bin assuming a global SED shape to translate the flux limit of the survey to a limiting dust mass at each redshift. This means that all galaxies in a bin are assumed to follow the same $M_{\textrm{dust}} - z$ relationship. \citealt{Dunne_2011} present a modified version of the PC00 method that allows each galaxy to set its own limiting $M_{\textrm{dust}} - z$ relationship, allowing for the range of SEDs observed in each bin. In this form, each galaxy in the bin has an individual contribution to the dust mass function such that

\begin{equation}
    \phi_{\textrm{est, Dunne}}(M_{\textrm{dust}},z) = \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{c_{\scriptscriptstyle \textrm{sub-mm}} c_{\scriptscriptstyle \textrm{id}}}{\int_{\scriptscriptstyle M_{\textrm{dust,1}}}^{\scriptscriptstyle M_{\textrm{dust,2}}} \int^{\scriptscriptstyle \textrm{survey}} \int_{\scriptscriptstyle z_1}^{\scriptscriptstyle \textrm{min}[z_2, z(M_{\textrm{dust}},S_{\textrm{lim,i}})]} D_H \frac{(1+z)^2 D_A^2}{E(z)} dz d\Omega d\textrm{log}_{10}(M_\textrm{dust})},
\label{eq:phi_pc00_dunne_method}
\end{equation}

\noindent where the integration over redshift is computed individually for each source. This has the added benefit of allowing a unique flux limit to be used for each galaxy $S_{\textrm{lim,i}}$, which is useful for surveys like H-ATLAS where source extraction is based on the SNR of the source rather than a single flux cut.

\subsection{Comparison of Estimators}

While the $1/V_{\textrm{max}}$ estimator is a perfectly adequate way of accounting for Malmquist bias, the PC00 method provides additional advantages for far-IR derived DMFs. Firstly, the accessible volume is not dependent on the dust mass of any individual galaxy, which can have significant uncertainties due to flux boosting. Second, the two approaches give very different answers when calculating the accessible volume inunderpopulated bins near the flux limit of the survey. Figure \ref{fig:volume_comparison} shows a comparison of the accessible volume calculation for an example $M_{\textrm{dust}} - z$ bin ($8 < \textrm{log}_{10}(M_\textrm{dust}) < 8.25, 0.2 < z < 0.4$). In this example of an undersampled bin, the volume calculated from the $1/V_{\textrm{max}}$ method will typically be an overestimate of the true region of the dust mass-volume space that has been surveyed, leading to an underestimate of the DMF in the lowest mass bin of a given redshift slice. In bins where all objects are brighter than the flux limit of the survey, the volume estimates yield the same result and we expect the DMFs to be identical.

Having defined an example dust mass - redshift bin ($8 < \textrm{log}(M_{\textrm{dust}} [M_{\odot}]) < 8.25$, $0.2 < z < 0.4$), the shaded areas in both panels represent the volume - dust mass space that is observable in a \textit{Herschel} survey with a limiting flux of 29.4\,mJy at 250\,\micron.

\section{The Dust Mass Function from Galaxies in the SGP}
\label{sec:dmf_from_sgp}

We apply the methods described above to the galaxies observed in the H-ATLAS SGP field. It is important to note that our sample is without spectroscopic redshifts and our dust masses are derived from sub-mm fluxes that are susceptible to flux boosting. The resulting scatter in the dust masses and redshifts could move galaxies between neighbouring bins. Given that the volume density is not uniform across bins and the survey is flux-limited, this introduces an Eddington bias (\citealt{Eddington_1913}) that broadens the DMF. For this reason, we model the errors as being formed in two parts. First, a Poissonian error that scales as $\sigma_{\phi,N} \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}$, where $N$ is the number of galaxies in each bin. The second error term is due to the spread in dust masses as a result of the large uncertainties on our photometric redshifts. When measuring the DMF we run 1000 Monte Carlo simulations in which we remeasure the DMF having perturbed the redshift of each galaxy according to a Gaussian distribution centered on the assumed redshift and with standard deviation equal to the error value. We use the standard deviation of the range of $\phi$ we observe in each $M_{\textrm{dust}} - z$ bin and add this error in quadrature to the Poissonian error: $\sigma_\phi = \sqrt{\sigma_{\phi,N}^2 + \sigma_{\phi,z}^2}$.

Figure \ref{fig:dmf_methods} shows the DMFs derived using the PC00 (solid lines, filled circles) and $1/V_{\textrm{max}}$ (dashed lines, filled circles) estimators for five redshift bins of width 0.2, assuming a universal dust temperature of 20\,K and dust emissivity index, $\beta = 2$. As a single SED is being assumed for all galaxies, we must also assume a single survey flux limit - which we take to be 29.4\,mJy at 250\,\micron\ (\citealt{Valiante_2016}). As one would expect from bins where the interval $\Delta M_{\textrm{dust}} \Delta z$ corresponds to objects brighter than the flux limit of the survey, the two estimators are equivalent. However, for $\phi_{1/V}$ there is a downturn in the lowest dust mass bin in most redshift slices, as we predicted earlier. The low-mass end of the DMF is typically described by a powerlaw with a slope, $\alpha$, taking values between -2 and -1. Our DMFs imply a much flatter value, suggesting that the number density of objects between dust masses of $10^{5.5}\,M_{\odot}$ and $10^{7.5}\,M_{\odot}$ is near constant. In light of previous H-ATLAS studies, we expect that this is not physical but rather an indication of an incomplete sample at the lowest masses. Given we are not using spectroscopic redshifts in our sample, we are likely missing these galaxies and therefore in subsequent analysis we shall assume that our DMFs are accurate above $\sim 10^{7.5}\,M_{\odot}$ and use the results of \citealt{Beeston_2018} to fill in the low-mass regime. 

We observe a clear evolution in the density of galaxies with high dust masses increasing with redshift. The evolution with lookback time is evident in each redshift slice, but noticably slows by the highest redshift bin. This may suggest that there is a point in time at redshifts $\gtrsim 0.8$ where the number density of the most massive galaxies peaks.

%\citealt{Dunne_2011} observed an apparent slow down in dust mass at higher redshift, but attributed this trend to a lack of spectroscopic redshifts in the highest bin used in their study ($0.4 < z < 0.5$). By using only photometric redshifts here, we expect any possible systematics from the redshift estimates to be an influencing factor in all redshift slices, so while this may add a systematic effect to all dust masses, the effect between subsequent bins is likely to be less severe. Also given the larger sample than \citealt{Dunne_2011}, we believe that this trend is a true slowing of the evolution in the most massive galaxies at redshifts $\gtrsim 0.6$. 

As an extension to our $\phi_{\textrm{est}}$ prediction of the DMF, we would like to be able to use the estimator of \citealt{Dunne_2011} (Equation \ref{eq:phi_pc00_dunne_method}) in which we calculate the acessible volume individually for each source. The problem we face is that this requires knowing the dust temperatures of all galaxies in our sample. While we are able to constrain the dust temperatures for a subset of our sample, we cannot depend on these sources alone without introducing another incompleteness to the sample. To avoid this problem we fit a single temperature modified blackbody to all galaxies with bounds on the cold ISM dust temperature between 15 and 25\,K and with a fixed $\beta = 2$. This range of temperatures was chosen as it has been shown to be a suitable range of cold dust temperatures in galaxies (\citealt{Dunne_2001}; \citealt{Smith_2012b}; \citealt{Clark_2015}; \citealt{Beeston_2018}). Galaxies that have well constrained peaks in the dust emission are likely to have dust temperatures within this range, and those that have insufficient far-IR data to fit an isothermal model are assumed to take a median value of 20\,K. This temperature for galaxies with poorly constrained dust SEDs is validated in previous studies (\citealt{Dunne_2011}; Beeston et al. in prep) that use sources that do have fits to define a linear relationship between 250\,\micron\ luminosity and dust mass. Using the best fitting relationship from these two studies is approximately the same as applying an isothermal modified blackbody model with 20\,K. Approximately 40\% of the galaxies in our sample have temperatures constrained between 15\,K and 25\,K; the remaining $\sim$ 60\% retain their 20\,K assumption. We use this set of dust temperatures to calculate $\phi_{\textrm{est, Dunne}}$ assuming an individual survey flux limit for each source. The flux limit for each galaxy is based on a minimum SNR of four. 

As pointed out in \citealt{Dunne_2011}, this estimator is not equivalent to $\phi_{1/V}$ despite the contribution to $\phi$ being calculated for each galaxy individually in both methods. In the former we still calculate an average accessible volume for each $M_{\textrm{dust}} - z$ bin, but we define the limiting dust mass -- redshift relationship for each source based on its own SED. This means we are more precise about the flux limit of the survey but do not depend on the uncertain dust mass of the source. Our estimate of $\phi_{\textrm{est, Dunne}}$ is included in Figure \ref{fig:dmf_methods} (dotted lines, open circles). As predicted, the \citealt{Dunne_2011} estimator of the DMF is broadly consistent with $\phi_{\textrm{est}}$, albeit with a wider distribution of dust masses due to the wider distribution of dust temperatures.

\begin{figure}

In each panel the DMFs from the first redshift bin are replotted for comparison in grey. The final panel shows the DMFs from all redshift bins.}
	\label{fig:dmf_methods}
\end{figure}

%The bottom panel of Figure \ref{fig:pc00_vmax_t20} illustrates the fractional error budget, $\sigma_\phi/\phi$, as a function of dust mass for the two uncertainty components: Poisson noise and photometric redshift uncertainty. We have assumed for now the contributions to the PC00 estimator, $\phi_{\textrm{est}}$, as both methods result in similar error distributions. {\color{red} Check that this is true.} The Poissonian fractional error is a reflection of the counts in each bin and thus the highest contributions occur at the high and low mass end of the DMF where the counts are lowest. 

\section{The Evolution in the Dust Content of SGP Galaxies}

In the following, we shall use the results of our two PC00 estimated DMFs to quantify the redshift evolution of dust mass in SGP galaixes. This is achieved in two ways: first by fitting Schechter functions to our DMFs and assessing the evolution in the Schechter parameters, and secondly, by calculating the dust mass density contained within galaxies at different epochs.

\subsection{Schechter Functions}
\label{sec:schechter_functions}

Luminosity functions, and by extension dust mass functions, are often modelled with analytical forms such as broken power laws or Schechter functions. The Schechter function takes the form

\begin{equation}
    \phi(M) dM = \phi^* (M/M^*)^\alpha e^{(-M/M^*)}\frac{dM}{M^*}
    \label{eq:schechter_function}
\end{equation}

\noindent in terms of mass, where $\alpha$ is the slope of the power law at masses below $M^*$; the characteristic dust mass where we transition from a power law to an exponential tail at high mass. The normalization is defined by $\phi^*$ which corresponds to the number density of galaxies at mass $M^*$. We can convert the Schechter function to logarithmic form using the fact that $\phi(\textrm{log}(M)) = \textrm{ln}(10)M\phi(M)$ such that

\begin{equation}
    \phi(\textrm{log}(M)) d\textrm{log}(M) = \textrm{ln}(10)\phi^* e^{-10^{\textrm{log}(M)-\textrm{log}(M^*)}}\times \Bigg(10^{\textrm{log}(M)-\textrm{log}(M^*)}\Bigg)^{\alpha+1} d\textrm{log}(M).
    \label{eq:schechter_function_log}
\end{equation}

We incorporate the factor $\textrm{ln}(10)$ into our definition of $\phi^*$ such that $\phi^*$ has units of Mpc$^{-3}$dex$^{-1}$. Given the incompleteness of the lowest mass bins at high redshifts, it is common to fit the three Schechter parameters ($\phi^*$, $M^*$ and $\alpha$) for the first redshift bin and make the assumption that the value of $\alpha$ does not vary with redshift. Due to our sample incompleteness at low dust masses, we fix our value of $\alpha$ to the \citealt{Beeston_2018} value of -1.22 for each redshift slice and only consider values greater than $10^{7.5}\,M_{\textrm{dust}}$ in our fit.

Figure \ref{fig:dmf_schechter} shows the best fit Schechter functions to our $\phi_{\textrm{est}}$ (solid lines, filled circles) and $\phi_{\textrm{est, Dunne}}$ (dotted lines, open circles) DMFs. The fitting parameters are also listed in Table \ref{tab:schechter_parameters}. Included in Figure \ref{fig:dmf_schechter} are the studies of \citealt{Vlahakis_2005}, \citealt{Dunne_2011}, \citealt{Beeston_2018} and \citealt{Pozzi_2020}. For a direct comparison between all works we have scaled the DMFs in the literature to the same cosmology ($\Omega_m = 0.3$, $\Omega_\Lambda = 0.7$ and $H_0 = 70$km s$^{-1}$Mpc$^{-1}$) and dust mass absorption coefficient ($\kappa_{250} = 0.89$m$^{2}$kg$^{-1}$). The Schechter functions presented in the literature are scaled to our cosmology and $\kappa_{250}$ on the basis that the dust mass depends on the choice of $\kappa_\nu$ and cosmology according to $M_{\textrm{dust}} \propto D_L^2/\kappa_\nu$ and the number density of galaxies is dependent on the choice of cosmology through the calculation of the accessible volume (Equations \ref{eq:volume_1/v_method} and \ref{eq:volume_pc00_method}).

The local DMFs ($z < 0.2$) are in good agreement except for the normalization found by \citealt{Dunne_2011} and the offset in dust mass with the study of \citealt{Pozzi_2020}. While it is hard to reconcile the low normalization of the \citealt{Dunne_2011} DMF with other works in the literature without a full understanding of the completeness of the respective samples at low flux densities, the shift in dust mass observed by \citealt{Pozzi_2020} in all redshift bins can be understood by comparing the selection wavelengths of the samples and their sensitivity to dust temperature. As mentioned earlier, estimating dust masses from sub-mm photometry is advantageous as the Rayleigh-Jeans (R-J) part of the Planck function is least sensitive to dust temperature and most sensitive to dust mass. In the R-J regime ($\lambda_{\textrm{rest}} \gg \frac{hc}{kT}$) the Planck function reduces to $B(\nu_{250}, T) = \frac{2\nu_{250}^{2}kT}{c^2}$ which means that in the optically thin and R-J regimes our dust masses are only linearly dependent on the dust temperature.

This work, as well as the studies of \citealt{Dunne_2011} and \citealt{Beeston_2018}, are based on samples of H-ATLAS sources which are primarily selected at 250\,\micron. In the rest frame of the highest redshift galaxies considered here, the selection wavelength is still expected to be on the long wavelength side of the peak in the blackbody. Further, at 850\,\micron, the SLUGS study of \citealt{Vlahakis_2005} is securely on the R-J side of the SED at the low redshifts probed in the SCUBA-selected study. As a result, these studies are sensitive to thermal emission from dust with fairly cool temperatures which should probe most of the dust mass. The 160\,\micron\ selection wavelength of \citealt{Pozzi_2020} means that in the rest frame this study probes different parts of the dust spectrum, crossing the peak to shorter wavelengths at $z \sim 0.5$. As we approach the peak of the dust SED an estimate of the dust mass becomes increasingly dependent on the estimate of the dust temperature - an effect that should also be noted when making conclusions from the highest redshift bins in our study. While the dependence on the dust temperature may be significantly higher in some studies, this does not necessarily mean that the conclusions drawn from them are incorrect. It is likely that comparing studies with long wavelength selection to short wavelength selection will exaggerate the differences in the DMFs if the average measured dust temperature is significantly different. {\color{red}Quick calculation.}

\subsection{Evolution of the Dust Mass Function}

Previously we highlighted that there appears to be an evolution in the density of galaxies with high dust masses with increasing redshift. To quantify this evolution, we can illustrate the variation in the characteristic dust mass and density in each redshift slice as obtained from our best fitting Schechter functions. Figure \ref{fig:dmf_schechter_parameters} shows the distribution of $\phi^*$ and $M_{\textrm{dust}}^*$ for our $\phi_{\textrm{est}}$ and $\phi_{\textrm{est, Dunne}}$ DMFs, as well as the studies considered in Figure \ref{fig:dmf_schechter}. We observe a strong evolution in the characteristic dust mass $M_{\textrm{dust}}^*$ with redshift, suggesting that galaxies become dustier at higher redshift. The density $\phi^*$ appears to decrease with redshift, but this is dependent on how well we account for the incompleteness in the sample as a function of redshift and is known to be degenerate with $M_{\textrm{dust}}^*$. The characteristic dust mass evolves from $M_{\textrm{dust}}^* = 6.18\times10^7\,M_{\odot}$ at $z < 0.2$ to $M_{\textrm{dust}}^* = 7.76\times10^8\,M_{\odot}$ at $z = 0.8 - 1$, assuming a universal dust temperature of 20\,K, suggesting a factor of $\sim 13$ in dust mass between the highest and lowest redshift bins. If we allow the $\sim 40\%$ of galaxies with well constrained dust temperatures to define their own K-corrections, then we observe a much steeper evolution from $M_{\textrm{dust}}^* = 6.71\times10^7\,M_{\odot}$ to $M_{\textrm{dust}}^* = 1.57\times10^9\,M_{\odot}$ over the same time period. This implies a factor increase twice as large compared to our $T_{\textrm{dust}}$ = 20\,K DMF.

The studies from the literature are the same as those given in Figure \ref{fig:dmf_schechter}. {\color{red}Dashed to dotted.}}
	\label{fig:dmf_schechter_parameters}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:dmf_m_evolution} shows the variation in the characteristic dust mass as a function of redshift. We fit the observed relationships with a function of the form $\textrm{log}(M_{\textrm{dust}}^*) = \textrm{log}(M_{\textrm{dust,0}}^*)(1+z)^\gamma$. The best fitting functions are given by $\textrm{log}(M_{\textrm{dust}}^*) = (7.66\pm0.10)(1+z)^{0.30\pm0.03}$ and $\textrm{log}(M_{\textrm{dust}}^*) = (7.65\pm0.05)(1+z)^{0.24\pm0.01}$ when assuming $T_{\textrm{dust}}$ = 20\,K. The $\textrm{log}(M_{\textrm{dust,0}})$ term represents a typical galaxy's dust mass at redshift zero, which is in excellent agreement between the two models. Using these fitted relationships we find that at $z = 1$, the galaxies detected by \textit{Herschel} were typically 60 times dustier ($\sim$ 25 times when assuming $T_{\textrm{dust}}$ = 20\,K) approximately 8\,Gyr ago. \citealt{Dunne_2011} found that the most massive galaxies at the highest redshifts probed in their study, $z \sim 0.5$, have dust masses a factor of 5 to 8 larger than those at $z \sim 0$, depending on whether we believe the fall in normalization, $\phi^*$, to be physical. At the same redshift, our empirical relationships find that the characteristic dust mass evolves by a factor of 6 -- 10, in good agreement with \citealt{Dunne_2011}.

\subsection{Dust Mass Density}

As the Schechter parameters are correlated, more meaningful estimators of the dust content of galaxies across cosmic time are the integrated dust mass density (DMD), $\rho_{\textrm{dust}}$, and the dust mass density parameter, $\Omega_{\textrm{dust}}$. We integrate the DMFs in each redshift slice to calculate the total amount of dust in galaxies at different epochs. This integration is given by

\begin{equation}
    \rho_{\textrm{dust}} = \int_0^\infty M_{\textrm{dust}} \phi(M_{\textrm{dust}}) dM_{\textrm{dust}} = \Gamma(2+\alpha) M_{\textrm{dust}}^* \phi^*,
    \label{eq:dust_mass_density}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\Gamma(x)$ represents the Gamma function, $\Gamma(x) = \int_0^\infty t^{x-1}e^{-t} dt$, and $\phi(M_{\textrm{dust}})$ has been substituted with the best fitting Schechter function. The dust mass density measured in this way is built upon a number of assumptions. First, it is assumed that the Schechter function is applicable at dust masses far below the range that has been directly measured. We could circumvent this problem by integrating to some common lower mass limit using the upper incomplete Gamma function, $\Gamma(x, z) = \int_z^\infty t^{x-1}e^{-t} dt$, however, all the studies considered here have varying levels of completeness at low masses and the integrated density without imposing this limit is negligibly different. The DMD calculated using Equation \ref{eq:dust_mass_density} serves as a maximal estimate of the dust mass density. Second, as stated previously, the low mass slope is assumed to be constant with redshift such that the number density of lower mass galaxies does not change with time. This assumption has no motivation, but is not expected to have a significant impact on our dust mass densities as the majority of the contribution by mass comes from the much fewer, more massive galaxies. {\color{red}Quick calculation.} The dust mass density parameter is obtained from $\Omega_{\textrm{dust}} = \rho_{\textrm{dust}}/\rho_{\textrm{crit}}$ where $\rho_{\textrm{crit}} = 1.36\times10^{11}\,M_{\odot}Mpc^{-3}$ is the critical density for our assumed cosmology. The dust densities are listed in Table \ref{tab:schechter_parameters} and shown in Figure \ref{fig:dmd} alongside the measured values for the studies previously mentioned. 

%Other approaches to measuring the dust density include integrating over a luminosity function of galaxies from the far-IR background radiation (e.g. \citealt{deBernadis_2012}; \citealt{Thacker_2013}) and from studying the extinction of background optical sources due to dust (e.g. \citealt{Driver_2007}; \citealt{Fukugita_2011}; \citealt{Menard_2012}). Despite the range of methods, most predictions are in good agreement at $z < 2$, where there is general consensus on a rapid decline from $z \sim 1$ to the present day. At higher redshifts we expect an increase in the dust mass density of approximately 1\,dex from $z \sim 5$ to $z \sim 1$ (\citealt{Peroux_2020}).

	\label{fig:dmd}
\end{figure}

In reasonable agreement with \citealt{Dunne_2011}, we predict a rapid evolution in dust mass density in the local universe, though it is notably less steep than the $(1+z)^{4.5}$ relationship observed in their study. Our measurement of the dust mass density suggests a factor $\sim$ 1.7 -- 2.6 increase between $0 < z < 0.2$ and $0.8 < z < 1$, beyond which the dust density remains constant, suggesting a peak at redshifts around 0.8 -- 1. The rapid decrease in dust density from $z \sim 1$ to the present day may have a number of possible causes. First, the depletion of dust due to star formation, owing to the fact that evolution in dust mass and SFR are intrinsically related since stars form out of gas and the dust is expected to trace the interstellar gas reservoir. The decline may also be attributed to dust destruction or dust lost from the galaxy to the halo (\citealt{Dunne_2011}). In contrast to the prevailing \textit{Herschel} view, \citealt{Driver_2018} find a relatively flat density at redshifts $< 0.5$, though it is noted that the method used to calculate the incompleteness in their sample differs from the one used here, and by extension in \citealt{Dunne_2011}, which may be the root cause of the difference.

The prediction of a peak in the dust density varies among studies. \citealt{Driver_2018} study the stellar mass and dust mass density of GAMA sources out to redshift five, and thus probe a large span of cosmic time in order to locate a peak in the dust density at $z \sim 1$. Our two DMFs predict a similarly timed peak in the dust density at $z \sim 0.8 - 1$. In contrast, the dust mass density described by \citealt{Dunne_2011} appears to drop in the last redshift bin ($0.4 < z < 0.5$) despite an increase in the characteristic dust mass, suggesting a peak at much later cosmic times. However, the significance of this result is doubtful as this drop in density could be attributed to incompleteness or a photometric redshift bias resulting from the lack of spectroscopic redshifts in this bin. In our study we only use photometric redshifts, but have factored the additional uncerainty this creates in our DMFs by running Monte Carlo simulations (Section \ref{sec:dmf_from_sgp}). We find that the contribution to the error budget from using photometric redshifts is of order the Poissonian errors and do not have a significant effect on the Schechter fitting and resulting dust mass densities. If, however, there were a systematic trend in the photometric redshifts, we might expect the observed evolution to change in rapidity and/or shift the apparent peak to different redshifts.

\subsection{Comparison of Dust Mass Density with the Star Formation Rate Density}

There is a direct link between star formation and the dust and gas content of galaxies. The Kennicutt-Schmidt relationship demonstrates the link between the gas and star formation rate surface densities of galaxies. Given that dust traces the gas in the ISM, there is a consequential link between dust content and the star formation activity. Moreover, the metals required for the sites of dust formation are produced as a result of the stellar life-cycle via AGB stars and supernovae. As a result, it is constructive to look at the dust mass density we observe from the galaxies in the SGP with the mean star formation rate in the universe.

The redshift dependence of the cosmic star formation history given by \citealt{Madau_2014}, which takes the form of a double power law in $(1 + z)$, is based on the best fit to multiple UV and IR data sets representing the unobscured and obscured star formation densities. Combining these surveys provides a clear and comprehensive picture of the cosmic star formation activity. The best fitting function is given by:

\begin{equation}
    \psi(z) = 0.015\frac{(1+z)^{2.7}}{1+[(1+z)/2.9]^{5.6}} [M_{\odot}\textrm{yr}^{-1}\textrm{Mpc}^{-3}].
    \label{eq:madau_sfrd}
\end{equation}

The above expression implies a cosmic star formation history that scales as $(1+z)^{-2.9}$ between $3 \lesssim z \lesssim 8$, a peak in the range $1.5 \lesssim z \lesssim 2$, and a decline of the form $(1+z)^{2.7}$ to the present day. Figure \ref{fig:sfrd} shows our measurements of the dust mass density alongside the measurements of the mean star formation rate in the universe compiled by \citealt{Madau_2014}. The offset between the two scales has been set to follow the relationship $\rho_{\textrm{dust}} = \rho_{\textrm{gas}}/\delta_{\textrm{gdr}} \sim \psi \times\tau_{\textrm{depl}}/\delta_{\textrm{gdr}}$, where we have assumed a typical depletion timescale, $\tau_{\textrm{depl}}$, of 500\,Myr and a gas mass to dust mass ratio, $\delta_{\textrm{gdr}}$, of 100. However, we do not intend for this to be interpreted as a suitable definition for the star formation density of SGP galaxies, rather as an approximation such that the two sets of measurements roughly coincide. 

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.75\columnwidth]{Figures/sfrd.pdf}
	\caption{The integrated dust density of SGP galaxies as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:dmd}. The blue error bars represent the various studies included in the fitting of \citealt{Madau_2014} for the cosmic star formation rate density (blue line). The two vertical axes have been scaled for illustrative purposes using $\rho_{\textrm{dust}} \sim \psi \times\tau_{\textrm{depl}}/\delta_{\textrm{gdr}}$, where we have assumed a typical depletion timescale of 500\,Myr and a gas mass to dust mass ratio of 100. The studies used in the measurement of the SFRD include: \citealt{Sanders_2003}, \citealt{Takeuchi_2003}, \citealt{Wyder_2005}, \citealt{Schiminovich_2005}, \citealt{Reddy_2009}, \citealt{Robotham_2011}, \citealt{Magnelli_2011}, \citealt{Cucciati_2012}, \citealt{Bouwens_2012b}, \citealt{Bouwens_2012a}, \citealt{Schenker_2013}, \citealt{Magnelli_2013}, \citealt{Gruppioni_2013} and \citealt{Dahlen_2007}.}
    \label{fig:sfrd}
\end{figure}

The similarity in the evolutions of the dust mass density and the star formation rate density (SFRD) to the present day show that the two are intrinsically linked and that the quantity of dust contained in galaxies is dependent on recent star formation. We know that dust can be formed in several ways, the most relevant sources being the stellar winds of evolved asymptotic giant branch (AGB) and red giant branch (RGB) stars, supernovae and grain growth in the ISM. These dust production mechanisms have appreciably different timescales, the shortest being from the two stellar sources. The short timescale ($\sim$ 2 -- 3\,Gyr) between the peak in the SFRD predicted by \citealt{Madau_2014} and the peak in the dust mass density measured by our DMFs gives credit to the idea that stellar sources form a substantial contribution to dust production.
