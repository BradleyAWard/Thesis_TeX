\section{Introduction}
\section{Dust Properties of DSFGs}

Interstellar dust plays a crucial role in the formation of galaxies as dust grains are the site of molecule formation like molecular hydrogen, $H_2$, the primary fuel for star formation (\citealt{Kennicutt_2012}). $H_2$ is the most abundant molecule in the Universe but is difficult to observe directly unless originating from energetic environments. Alternatives include observing less abundant molecules such as CO and using conversion factors to estimate the mass of molecular hydrogen, or observing dust emission to estimate dust masses (as in the previous chapter) and assuming gas-to-dust ratios (e.g. \citealt{Saintonge_2013}) to convert these into estimates for the total gas mass in high-redshift galaxies (e.g. \citealt{Eales_2012}; \citealt{Scoville_2014}). Such studies have shown that galaxies at high redshift contain a higher fraction of gas than galaxies today (\citealt{Tacconi_2010}; \citealt{Scoville_2016}; \citealt{Scoville_2017}; \citealt{Millard_2020}), showing that direct observations of dust emission are useful in our understanding of how galaxies grow and evolve. It is important to note, however, that studies that make these links between dust emission and the evolution of galactic properties make the basic assumption that properties of the dust remain constant with redshift. In the following we investigate the possibility of evolution in dust itself by modelling the dust emission from a sample of high-redshift galaxies and inferring their dust properties over a large expanse of cosmic history.

Of particular importance to us is the dust emissivity spectral index, $\beta$, which controls the frequency dependence of the emissivity of dust grains per unit mass. By assuming as is customary that the optical depth of a galaxy can be approximated as a power law of the form $\tau \propto \nu^\beta$, we are implicity assuming that $\beta$ encodes within it information about the dust grain properties such as their chemical composition and their size and growth. The assumed value of $\beta$ for a galaxy can have significant consequences on the assumed absorption properties of the dust grains and consequently on fundamental properties of the ISM in the galaxy such as the total mass of dust (\citealt{Bianchi_2013}; \citealt{Clark_2016}).
