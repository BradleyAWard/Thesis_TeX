\section{The Far-Infrared/Radio Correlation}

For samples of star forming galaxies in the local and high redshift universe there is a well observed correlation between the far-infrared and radio emission (e.g. \citealt{Dickey_1984}; \citealt{deJong_1985}; \citealt{Helou_1985}; \citealt{Condon_1992}; \citealt{Barger_2000}; \citealt{Yun_2001}; \citealt{Garrett_2002}; \citealt{Appleton_2004}; \citealt{Ibar_2008}; \citealt{Seymour_2009}; \citealt{Sargent_2010}), that remains nearly linear over multiple orders of magnitude in far-infrared luminosity ($10^{9} \lesssim L_{\textrm{FIR}} [L_{\odot}] \lesssim 10^{12.5}$). The small scatter in this relation is often attributed to the "calorimeter model" (\citealt{Voelk_1989}; \citealt{Lisenfeld_1996}; \citealt{Lacki_2010}), which ascribes the far-infrared and radio emission to common stellar sources. In this model, galaxies are assumed to be opaque to UV light from massive OB stars which gets absorbed by the dust in the ISM and reradiated in the far-infrared. Observations in the far-infrared and sub-mm are thus sensitive to the cold dust that reradiates the energy from young stars. These stars quickly come to the end of their lives, exploding as Type II supernovae producing cosmic ray electrons and positrons. Most of their energy gets radiated in the radio as synchrotron radiation when interacting with the magnetic fields of the supernova remnant. The radio continuum is therefore a tracer of recent, obscured star formation.

Despite a higher scatter for high redshift SMGs than with local samples, the far-infrared/radio correlation (FIRC) still holds at increasing redshift (\citealt{Ivison_2010a}; \citealt{Ivison_2010b}). {\color{red}Small description on evolution of FIRC with redshift.}

The appearance of a correlation at all redshifts and luminosities has facilitated studies that use the radio emission as an unbiased tracer of obscured star formation in dusty galaxies (\citealt{Kennicutt_2012}). By making use of the tight correlation (as well as the benefits we outline in the following section), we can identify counterparts to single dish sub-mm observations with large beams with greater confidence than we would expect from the optical or near-infrared. This allows for better characterization of the properties of SMGs and allows us to study the cosmic star formation history to higher redshifts (\citealt{Madau_2014}; \citealt{Delhaize_2017}; \citealt{Novak_2017}).
