\section{The Herschel-ATLAS}
The \textit{Herschel} Astrophysical Terahertz Large Area Survey (H-ATLAS; \citealt{Eales_2010}) was the largest open-time sub-mm survey carried out with \textit{Herschel}. The survey was observed across five photometric bands using two instruments onboard the \textit{Herschel Space Observatory}: the Photodetector Array Camera (PACS, \citealt{Poglitsch_2010}) at 100 and 160\,\micron, and the Spectral and Photometric Imaging Receiver (SPIRE, \citealt{Griffin_2010}) at 250, 350 and 500\,\micron. Compared to the first SMGs ({\color{orange} Assumption: I have already described SMGs and their initial discovery in the 80s/90s.}) detected using SCUBA at 850\,\micron (\citealt{Smail_1997}; \citealt{Barger_1998}; \citealt{Hughes_1998}), the PACS and SPIRE wavebands span the peak of the infrared spectrum for low redshift (z < 1) galaxies. Their intrinsic brightness at the SPIRE wavelengths makes their detection in the thousands more achievable. 

%{\color{orange}The main scientific goal of the H-ATLAS was to provide measurements of the dust masses and dust obscured star formation for tens of thousands of nearby galaxies (to create and FIR/sub-mm analogue to the SDSS). The original goal was to provide a shallow survey over a large area of sky, but the exceptional sensitivity of \textit{Herschel} and the negative k-correction at sub-mm wavelengths (References) means a significant fraction of sources lie at high redshifts (References). While the original goal was to study dust and newly formed stars hidden by dust in nearby (z < 0.4) galaxies, the negative k-correction mean that the median redshift of sources is z $\sim$ 1. The source catalogues include sources up to a redshift of at least 6 (References).}

The complete survey covers $\sim$\,660\,$\deg^2$, split into three regions located to avoid emission from Galactic dust and to utilize complimentary spectroscopic surveys including the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS, \citealt{York_2000}), the 2df Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dfGRS, \citealt{Colless_2001}) and the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA, \citealt{Driver_2009}). The North Galactic Pole (NGP) region covers $\sim$\,180\,$\deg^2$ of the northern sky, centered at R.A 13$^{h}$18$^{m}$ and declination +29$^{\circ}$13' (J2000); three equatorial fields, located at approximately R.A 9$^{h}$, 12$^{h}$ and 15$^{h}$ coinciding with the GAMA survey (henceforth named GAMA9, GAMA12 and GAMA15 fields), each with an area of approximately 54\,$\deg^2$, and the South Galactic Pole (SGP) region, centered at R.A 0$^{h}$6$^{m}$ and declination -32$^{\circ}$44' (J2000) with an area of $\sim$ 318\,$\deg^2$.
